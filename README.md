# QuiNE-ground-truth-1.0
The QuiNE-ground-truth-1.0 contains
(a) a corpus;
(b) a conceptual model and multiple research questions, distilled from the model by experts, that can be answered on the basis of the corpus; 
(c) lists of terms (preferably hierarchically ordered) manually selected and linked by experts to the concepts appearing in the model; 
(d) automatically segmentable fragments of text, ideally paragraphs, in which terms linked to the concepts appear and that are judged by experts relevant to the research questions, preferably with a varying degree of relevance.
